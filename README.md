### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working for [Criptonautas](https://criptonautas.co) but for freedom first, so I was moving out my own profile in order to disable my ID.

Not a dev, not an engineer, not a product manager but working like them because I enjoy to learn and discover always new things for the crowd.
